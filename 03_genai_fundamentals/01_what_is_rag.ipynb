    "# What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that enhances the responses of LLMs by providing them with relevant, up-to-date information retrieved from external sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG helps generate more accurate and tailored answers, especially when the required information is not present in the model’s training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG process typically involves three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the User Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The system first interprets the user’s input or question to determine what information is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Information Retrieval**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A retriever searches external data sources (such as documents, databases, or knowledge graphs) to find relevant information based on the user’s query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The retrieved information is inserted into the prompt, and the language model uses this context to generate a more accurate and relevant response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grounding\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of providing context to an LLM to improve the accuracy of its responses and reduce the likelihood of hallucinations is known as Grounding.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Retrievers\n",
    "\n",
    "he retriever is a key component of the RAG process. A retriever is responsible for searching and retrieving relevant information from external data sources based on the user’s query.\n",
    "\n",
    "A retriever typically takes an unstructured input (like a question or prompt) and searches for structured data that can provide context or answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neo4j support various methods for building retrievers, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Full-text search**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector search**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text to Cypher**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will explore these methods in the rest of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sources used in the RAG process can vary widely, depending on the application and the type of information needed. Common data sources include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documents**: Textual data sources, such as articles, reports, or manuals, that can be searched for relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **APIs**: External services that can provide real-time data or specific information based on user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge Graphs**: Graph-based representations of information that can provide context and relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Semantic Search\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of RAG is understanding what the user is asking for and finding the correct information to pass to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search aims to understand search phrases' intent and contextual meaning, rather than focusing on individual keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional keyword search often depends on exact-match keywords or proximity-based algorithms that find similar words.\n",
    "\n",
