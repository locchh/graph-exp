    "## What is a Knowledge Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "*A knowledge graph is an organized representation of real-world entities and their relationships.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs provide a structured way to represent entities, their attributes, and their relationships, allowing for a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs are useful for Generative AI applications because they provide structured, interconnected data that enhances context, reasoning, and accuracy in generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search engines typically use knowledge graphs to provide information about people, places, and things.\n",
    "\n",
    "This knowledge graph could represent Neo4j:\n",
    "An example of a knowledge graph of Neo4j showing the relationships between people, places, and things\n",

    "Knowledge graphs can break down sources of information and integrate them, allowing you to see the relationships between the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integration from diverse sources gives knowledge graphs a more holistic view and facilitates complex queries, analytics, and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs can readily adapt and evolve as they grow, taking on new information and structure changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph stores data and relationships alongside frameworks known as organizing principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organizing principles are the rules or categories around the data that provide structure to the data. Organizing principles can range from simple data descriptions, for example, describing a GraphAcademy course as course → modules → lessons, to a complex vocabulary of the complete solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs are inherently flexible, and you can change the organizing principles as the data grows and changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The organizing principles describing the content in GraphAcademy could look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The organizing principles are stored as nodes in the graph and can be stored alongside the actual data.\n",

    "## Generative AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "In Generative AI applications, knowledge graphs play a crucial role by capturing and organizing important domain-specific or proprietary company information. They are not limited to strictly structured data—knowledge graphs can also integrate and represent less organized or unstructured information.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphRAG can use knowledge graphs for context, forming the foundation for applications that leverage proprietary or domain-specific data. By grounding responses in a knowledge graph, these applications can provide more accurate answers and greater explainability, thanks to the rich context and relationships present in the data.\n",

    "# Creating Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "How you create a knowledge graph depends on the type of data you have and how you want to structure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unstructured data\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured data, such as text documents, web pages, or PDFs, can be a rich source for knowledge graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating knowledge graphs from unstructured data can be complex, involving multiple steps of data query, cleanse, and transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can use the text analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to help automate knowledge graph creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you would follow these steps to construct a knowledge graph from unstructured text using an LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gather the data** - The data could be from multiple sources and in different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunk the data** - Break down the data into manageable parts, or chunks, that the LLM can process effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vectorize the data** - Depending on your requirements for querying and searching the data, you may need to create **vector embeddings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pass the data to an LLM** - Extract entities (nodes) and relationships from the data. You may provide additional context or constraints for the extraction, such as the type of entities or relationships you are interested in extracting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generate the graph** - Use the output from the LLM to create nodes and relationships in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unstructured Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical structure for the knowledge graph could look like this:\n",

    "## Structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing knowledge graphs from structured data is often more straightforward than from unstructured sources. Structured data is already organized, making it easier to map nodes, relationships, and relationships directly into a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a knowledge graph from structured data, you typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the sources** - The data sources could be other graphs, relational database, CSV files, APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analysize the data** - Understand the entities, attributes, and relationships in your data (for example, rows in a table may represent entities, columns as attributes, and foreign keys as relationships).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define a graph schema** - The schema should represent the entities as nodes and relationships as well as defining the organizing principles for the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create the graph** - Transform and import the data into the graph database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process allows you to leverage existing structured data sources—such as relational databases, CSV files, or APIs—to quickly build a knowledge graph that can be queried and expanded as needed."
