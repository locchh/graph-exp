    "## Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large amounts of data, breaking it into smaller, more manageable parts is helpful. This process is called chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller pieces of data are easier to work with and process. Embedding models also have size (token) limits and can only handle a certain amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding large amounts of text may also be less valuable. For example, if you are trying to find a document that references a specific topic, the meaning maybe lost in the whole document. Instead, you may only need the paragraph or sentence that contains the relevant information. Conversely, small amounts of data may not contain enough context to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will explore strategies for chunking and storing data in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are countless strategies for splitting data into chunks, and the best approach depends on the data and the problem you are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be that the unstructured data you are working with is already in a format that is easy to split. For example, if you were looking to chunk an API’s technical documentation, you could split the data by method, endpoint, or parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you may be working with a collection of unrelated PDF documents, and splitting by section, paragraph, or sentence may be the only choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategies for chunking data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size** - Splitting data into equal-sized chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word, Sentence, Paragraph** - Breaking down text data into individual sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N-Grams** - Creating chunks of n consecutive words or characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Topic Segmentation** - Dividing text into sections based on topic changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event Detection** - Identifying specific events or activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Segmentation** - Dividing data regions with different semantic meanings (objects, background, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be helpful to combine multiple strategies. For example, you could split a document into paragraphs and then further split each paragraph into topic changes - this would allow you to store and query the data at different levels of granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "How you store the chunks depends on the data, what the chunks represent, and how you intend to use the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to name the nodes and relationships in a way that makes it easy to understand the data and how it is related. For example, if you split a set of documents by paragraph, you could name the nodes `Documents` and `Paragraph` with a relationship `CONTAINS`. Alternatively, if you split a document by an arbitrary size value or character, you may simply use the node label `Chunk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can store embeddings for individual chunks and create relationships between chunks to capture context and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also want to store metadata about the chunks, such as the position in the original data, the size, and any other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "When storing the course content, you will create a node for each `Paragraph` chunk and a relationship `CONTAINS` between the `Lesson` and `Paragraph` nodes.\n",
    "\n",

    "        courses - the course content\n",

identified in vast amounts of data. \\n\\nDue to their reliance on patterns and the sheer volume of training information, LLMs sometimes **hallucinate** or produce outputs that manifest as generating untrue facts, asserting details with unwarranted confidence, or crafting plausible yet nonsensical explanations.\\n\\nThese manifestations arise from a mix of _overfitting_, biases in the training data, and the model\\'s attempt to generalize from vast amounts of information.\\n\\n== Common Hallucination Problems\\n\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at some reasons why this may occur.\\n\\n=== Temperature\\n\\nLLMs have a _temperature_, corresponding to the amount of randomness the underlying model should use when generating the text.\\n\\nThe higher the temperature value, the more random the generated result will become, and the more likely the response will contain false statements.\\n\\nA higher temperature may be appropriate when configuring an LLM to respond with more diverse and creative outputs, but it comes at the expense of consistency and precision.\\n\\nFor example, a higher temperature may be suitable for constructing a work of fiction or a novel joke.\\n\\nOn the other

contained six fictitious case citations.\\n====\\n\\nA quick fix _may_ be to reduce the temperature. But more likely, the LLM is hallucinating because it hasn't got the information required.\\n\\n=== Missing Information\\n\\nThe training process for LLMs is intricate and time-intensive, often requiring vast datasets compiled over extended periods. As such, these models might lack the most recent information or might miss out on specific niche topics not well-represented in their training data.\\n\\nFor instance, if an LLM's last update were in September 2022, it would be unaware of world events or advancements in various fields that occurred post that date, leading to potential gaps in its knowledge or responses that seem out of touch with current realities.\\n\\nIf the user asks a question on information that is hard to find or outside of the public domain, it will be virtually impossible for an LLM to respond accurately.\\n\\nLuckily, this is where factual information from data sources such as knowledge graphs can help.\\n\\n=== Model Training and Complexity\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'llm-vectors-unstructured/data/asciidoc/courses/llm-fundamentals/modules/1-introduction/lessons/2-hallucination/lesson.adoc'}, page_content='Luckily, this is where factual information from data sources such as knowledge graphs can help.\\n\\n=== Model Training and Complexity\\n\\nThe complexity of Large Language Models, combined with potential training on erroneous or misleading data, means that their outputs can sometimes be unpredictable or inaccurate.\\n\\nFor example, an LLM might produce a biased or incorrect answer when asked about a controversial historical event. \\n\\nFurthermore, it would be near impossible to trace back how the model arrived at that conclusion.\\n\\n== Improving LLM Accuracy\\n\\nThe following methods can be employed to help guide LLMs to produce more consistent and accurate results.\\n\\n=== Prompt Engineering\\n\\nPrompt engineering is developing specific and deliberate instructions that guide the LLM toward the desired response.\\n\\nBy refining how you pose instructions, developers can achieve better results from existing models without retraining.\\n\\nFor example, if you require a blog post summary, rather than asking _\"What is this blog post about?\"_, a more appropriate response would be _\"Provide a concise, three-sentence summary and three tags for this blog post.\"_\\n\\nYou could also include _\"Return the response as JSON\"_ and provide an example output to make it easier to parse in the programming language of your choice.\\n\\nProviding additional instructions and context in the question is known as **Zero-shot learning**.\\n\\n[TIP]\\n.Be Positive\\n====\\nWhen writing a prompt, aim to provide positive instructions.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'llm-vectors-unstructured/data/asciidoc/courses/llm-fundamentals/modules/1-introduction/lessons/2-hallucination/lesson.adoc'}, page_content='Providing additional instructions and context in the question is known as **Zero-shot learning**.\\n\\n[TIP]\\n.Be Positive\\n====\\nWhen writing a prompt, aim to provide positive instructions.\\n\\nFor example, when asking an expert to provide a description, you could say, \"Do not use complex words.\" However, the expert\\'s interpretation of complex might be different from yours.

OpenAI LLM using Langchain.\\n\\nThe communication was simple, you provided a prompt and got a response.\\n\\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to use a chat model to _have a conversation_ with the LLM.\\n\\n== Chat Models vs Language Models\\n\\nUntil now, you have been using a language model to communicate with the LLM. \\nA language model predicts the next word in a sequence of words. \\nChat models are designed to have conversations - they accept a list of messages and return a conversational response.\\n\\nChat models typically support different types of messages:\\n\\n* System - System messages instruct the LLM on how to act on human messages\\n* Human - Human messages are messages sent from the user\\n* AI - Responses from the AI are called AI Responses\\n\\n== Create a Chat Model\\n\\nYou are going to create an application that uses a chat model.\\n\\nThe application will:\\n\\n* Use a system message to provide instructions\\n* Use a human message to ask a question\\n* Receive an AI response to the question\\n\\nCreate a new Python program, import the required LangChain modules and instantiate the chat model.\\n\\n[IMPORTANT]\\n.OpenAI API Key\\nRemember to update the API key with your own.\\n\\n[source,python]\\n----\\ninclude::code/chat-model.py[tag=import]\\n\\ninclude::code/chat-model.py[tag=llm]\\n----', 'source':

Wrapping in a Chain\\n\\nYou can create a reusable chat model chain using what you have learned about prompts and chains.\\n\\nRather than passing a list of messages to the chat model, you can create a prompt that gives context to the conversation and then pass the question to the chat model.\\n\\nReview this program and identify the following:\\n\\n. The prompt is created by combining `system` and `human` messages.\\n. The chain is created using the chat model, the prompt and an output parser.\\n. The question is passed to the chat model as a parameter of the `invoke` method.\\n\\n[source,python]\\n----\\ninclude::code/chat-model-chain.py[tag=**]\\n----\\n\\nCreating a chain is the first step to creating a more sophisticated chat model. \\nYou can use chains to combine different elements into one call and support more complex features.\\n\\n=== Giving context\\n\\nPreviously, you learned about grounding and how it can provide context to the LLM and avoid _Hallucination_.\\n\\nCurrently, the chat model is not grounded; it is unaware of surf conditions on the beach. \\nIt responds based on the question and the LLMs training data (which could be months or years out of date).\\n\\nYou can ground the chat model by providing information about the surf conditions on the beach.\\n\\nReview this example where the chat model can access current beach conditions (`current_weather`) as a system message (`context`) in the prompt.\\n\\n[source,python]\\n----\\ninclude::code/chat-model-context.py[]\\n----', 'source':

Langchain\\n:order: 1\\n:type: lesson\\n\\nThis lesson will teach you about Langchain, an open-source framework for building AI applications.\\n\\n== What is Langchain?\\n\\nlink:https://langchain.com[LangChain^] is designed to accelerate the development of LLM applications.\\n\\nLangchain enables software developers to build LLM applications quickly, integrating with external components and data sources.\\n\\nDevelopers can build Langchain applications with link:https://python.langchain.com/[Python^] or link:https://js.langchain.com/[JavaScript/TypeScript^].\\n\\nLangchain supports multiple LLMs and allows you to swap one for another with a single parameter change.\\n\\nMeaning you can quickly test multiple LLMs for suitability and utilize different models for different use cases.\\n\\nLangchain provides out-of-the-box integrations with APIs and databases including link:https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/neo4j[Neo4j^].\\n\\nLangchain's flexibility allows you to test different LLM providers and models with minimal code changes.\\n\\n== How does it work?\\n\\nLangChain applications bridge users and LLMs, communicating back and forth with the LLM through **Chains**.\\n\\nThe key components of a Langchain application are:\\n\\n* **Model Interaction (Model I/O)**: Components that manage the interaction with the language model, overseeing tasks like feeding inputs and extracting outputs.\", 'source':

Initialising the LLM\\n:order: 2\\n:type: lesson\\n\\nIn this lesson, you will:\\n\\n* Install the Langchain Python package\\n* Initialize an LLM\\n* Get a response from the LLM using a *Prompt*\\n\\n== Choosing your LLM\\n\\nLangchain supports multiple LLM providers (link:https://openai.com/[OpenAI^], link:https://cohere.com/[Cohere^], link:https://ollama.ai/[Ollama^] and more). The quality and cost vary. LLMs are also trained for different purposes, so it is worth experimenting with models and prompts. Depending on your use case, different LLMs may return better results.\\n\\nThis course includes instructions for using link:https://openai.com/[OpenAI^], but the same principles apply to all LLMs.\\n\\n[NOTE]\\n.Using OpenAI\\nIf you wish to use OpenAI and follow this course's practical activities, you must create an account and set up billing.\\n\\n== Setup\\n\\n=== Installing Langchain\\n\\nTo use Langchain, you must install the `langchain` package and its dependencies using `pip`:\\n\\n[source,sh]\\n.Install Langchain\\npip install langchain\\n\\n[TIP]\\n.Virtual Environment\\n====\\nYou may find it helpful to create a Python virtual environment using a tool like link:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/[virtualenv^]. Using a virtual environment allows you to install packages without affecting your system Python installation.\\n====\\n\\nDuring the course, you will also be using components from the `neo4j`, `langchain-community` and `langchainhub` packages:\\n\\n[source,sh]\\n.Install Langchain\\npip install langchain-community langchainhub neo4j\", 'source':

The input variables will be validated when the prompt is formatted, and a `KeyError` will be raised if any variables are missing from the input.\\n\\nThe prompt will be formatted as follows:\\n\\n    You are a cockney fruit and vegetable seller.\\n    Your role is to assist your customer with their fruit and vegetable needs\\n    Respond using cockney rhyming slang.\\n    Tell me about the following fruit: apple\\n\\nWhen running the program, you should see a response similar to:\\n\\n    Well, apples is a right corker - they come in all shapes and sizes from Granny Smiths to Royal Galas. Got \\'em right \\'ere, two a penny - come and grab a pick of the barrel!\\n\\n[NOTE]\\n.Differing Results\\nIf you run the program multiple times, you will notice you get different responses because the LLM is generating the answer each time.\\n\\nBefore moving on to the next lesson, try creating a prompt template and using it to get a response from the LLM.\\n\\n[TIP]\\n.Creating

with Neo4j, including allowing you to run Cypher statements, query vector indexes and use Neo4j as a conversation memory store.\\n\\nIn this lesson, you will learn how to connect to and use a Neo4j database as a conversation memory store.\\n\\nStoring conversation history in a Neo4j database allows you to analyze the conversation history to understand trends and improve outcomes.\\n\\n== Connecting to a Neo4j instance\\n\\nThe following code will connect to a Neo4j database and run a simple query.\\n\\n[source,python]\\n----\\ninclude::code/connect-to-neo4j.py[]\\n----\\n\\nYou can connect to the Neo4j sandbox created for you when you joined the course.\\n\\nUpdate the code above to use the `url`, `username` and `password` of your Neo4j sandbox.\\n\\nConnection URL:: [copy]#bolt://{sandbox-ip}:{sandbox-boltPort}#\\nUsername:: [copy]#{sandbox-username}#\\nPassword:: [copy]#{sandbox-password}#\\n\\nRun the query - you should see data about the movie Toy Story.\\n\\nThe `Neo4jGraph` class is a wrapper to the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/[Neo4j Python driver^].\\nIt simplifies connecting to Neo4j and integrating with the Langchain framework.\\n\\n=== Schema\\n\\nWhen you connect to the Neo4j database, the object loads the database schema into memory - this enables Langchain to access the schema information without having to query the database.', 'source': 'llm-vectors-unstructured/data/asciidoc/courses/llm-fundamentals/modules/3-intro-to-langchain/lessons/3.7-persist-memory/lesson.adoc', 'embedding':
