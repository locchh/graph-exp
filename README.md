# Graph Experiments

When constructing a knowledge graph from unstructured text, you typically follow these steps:

- Gather the data

- Chunk the data ( break down the data into right-sized )

- Vectorize the data

- Pass the data to an LLM to extract nodes and relationships

- Use the output to generate the graph
