    "# Query and visualize your graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Cypher is a declarative query language for graphs, and should be easy to get started with for anyone who is familiar with SQL. Kuzu’s implementation of Cypher is based on the [openCypher standard](https://opencypher.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways you can query an existing Kuzu database:\n",
    "- **CLI**: Write Cypher queries directly in the Kuzu CLI shell.\n",
    "- **Kuzu Explorer**: Interactively write and run Cypher queries using [Kuzu Explorer](https://kuzudb.github.io/visualization/kuzu-explorer/), a web-based query interface that also provides graph visualization.\n",
    "- **Client APIs**: Integrate Kuzu in your application using your preferred programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cypher introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we’ll demonstrate how to run Cypher queries using Kuzu Explorer. You are welcome to run the same queries via the CLI or your preferred client language APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using Kuzu Explorer to run queries during the prototyping and exploration phase is that you can visualize the graph as you query it. Additionally, you can view the query results as a table or as JSON, allowing you to easily design and test your application logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open a database in Kuzu Explorer\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the appropriate version of Kuzu Explorer via Docker as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \\\n",
    "    -v /path/to/example.kuzu:/database \\\n",
    "    kuzudb/explorer:latest\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -p 8000:8000 \\\n",
    "           -v /path/to/local/directory:/database \\\n",
    "           -e KUZU_FILE=example.kuzu \\\n",
    "           --rm kuzudb/explorer:latest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And access via `http://localhost:8000/`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can alternatively install a specific version of Kuzu Explorer by replacing latest with the version number, such as `kuzudb/explorer:0.xx.0`. The explorer version must match the Kuzu version used to create any existing database in the provided path to ensure storage format compatibility."

    "\n",
    "Similar to [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in relational databases, it is possible to have Cypher injection in graph databases.

To avoid such security issues, it is generally a good practice to provide parameters to your Cypher queries instead of using concatenated string queries.\n",

    "# Scan data from various sources\n",
    "\n",
    "Cypher supports the `LOAD FROM` clause to scan data from various sources. Scanning is the act of reading data from a source, but not inserting it into the database. Inserting data into the database involves “copying”; see the [Import data](https://kuzudb.github.io/import) section for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scanning data using `LOAD FROM` is useful to inspect a subset of your data, understand its structure, and perform transformations like rearranging columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a `user.csv` file that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "name,age\n",
    "Adam,30\n",
    "Karissa,40\n",
    "Zhang,50\n",
    "Noura,25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can scan the file and count the number of rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "LOAD FROM \"user.csv\" (header = true)\n",
    "RETURN COUNT(*);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also apply filter predicates via the `WHERE` clause, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "LOAD FROM \"user.csv\" (header = true)\n",
    "WHERE age > 25\n",
    "RETURN COUNT(*);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when scanning from CSV files, Kuzu will attempt to auto-cast the data to the correct type when possible. For example, the `age` column is cast to an `INT64` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can reorder the columns by simply returning them in the order you want. The `LIMIT` keyword can be used to limit the number of rows returned. The example below returns the first two rows, with the `age` and `name` columns in the order specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "LOAD FROM \"user.csv\" (header = true)\n",
    "RETURN age, name\n",
    "LIMIT 2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## More features\n",
    "\n",
    "`LOAD FROM` is a general-purpose clause in Cypher for scanning data from various data sources, including files and in-memory DataFrames. See the detailed documentation below for more details on how to use the `LOAD FROM` clause."
